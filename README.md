# substitute
A program that takes a key and code and input and returns an integer value that has been represented by the code.
Ex. KEY - lucas CODE - mia; 
since a is the 4th letter in the key and a is also the only letter in the code the the integer value returned is 4.  This was my solution 
to a practice problem taken from the topcoder.com website.
